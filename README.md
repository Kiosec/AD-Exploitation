## Active Directory enumeration through Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

##### ➤ Requirements
- RDP or GUI access
- RSAT feature activated or can be activated

##### ➤ Limits
- The GUI requires RDP access to the machine where it is executed.
- Although searching for an object is fast, gathering AD wide properties or attributes cannot be performed. 

##### ➤ Detect if MMC is installed/activated

```
1. Right click on Windows
2. Click on 'run'
3. Write 'MMC' and execute 
```

##### ➤ Install MMC

If the Microsoft Management Console is not directly installed, you can perform the following steps to install RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) which include MMC.

```
1. Press Right on Windows
2. Search 'Apps and Features'
3. Click 'Manage Optional Features'
4. Click 'Add a feature'
5. Search for 'RSAT'
6. Select 'RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Tools' and click Install
```

You can now execute MMC, then we can now attach the AD RSAT Snap-In:
```
1. Click File -> Add/Remove Snap-in
2. Select and Add all three Active Directory Snap-ins
3. Click through any errors and warnings
4. Right-click on Active Directory Domains and Trusts and select Change Forest
Enter <YOUR_DOMAIN> as the Root domain and Click OK
5. Right-click on Active Directory Sites and Services and select Change Forest
Enter <YOUR_DOMAIN> as the Root domain and Click OK
6. Right-click on Active Directory Users and Computers and select Change Domain
Enter <YOUR_DOMAIN> as the Domain and Click OK
7. Right-click on Active Directory Users and Computers in the left-hand pane
8. Click on View -> Advanced Features
```

##### ➤ Execute MMC

```
1. Right click on Windows
2. Click on 'run'
3. Write 'MMC' and execute 
```

***Run MMC with a specific user (RUNAS):*** This is where the Runas window  comes into play. In that window, we can start MMC, which will ensure that all MMC network connections will use our injected AD credentials.


## Active Directory enumeration through Command Prompt

##### ➤ Advantages and Limits
```
Advantages :
- No tools are required
- No GUI is required
- VBScript and other macro languages that are often used for phishing payloads support these commands natively so they can be used to enumerate initial information regarding the AD domain before more specific payloads are crafted.

Limits :
- The net commands must be executed from a domain-joined machine. However, it will the WORKGROUP default domain.
- The net commads may not show all information (e.g., if a user is a member of more than 10 groups).
```

##### ➤ List all users in the AD domain
```
C:\>net user /domain
```

##### ➤ Enumerate more detailed information about a single user account
```
C:\>net user <username> /domain
```

##### ➤ List all groups of the domain
```
C:\>net group /domain
```

##### ➤ Enumerate more detailed information about a group
```
C:\>net group "<group_name>" /domain
```

##### ➤ Enumerate the password policy of the domain
```
C:\>net accounts /domain
```

## Active Directory enumeration through Powershell

##### ➤ Enumerate a specific AD users

- -Identity : The account name that we are enumerating
- -Properties : Which properties associated with the account will be shown, * will show all properties
- -Server : Since we are not domain-joined, we have to use this parameter to point it to our domain controller

```
# Get-ADUser -Identity <username> -Server <AD_name> -Properties *
PS C:\Get-ADUser -Identity kiosec -Server my.domain.com -Properties *
AccountExpirationDate                :
accountExpires                       : 9223372036854775807
AccountLockoutTime                   :
[...]
Deleted                              :
Department                           : Consulting
Description                          :
DisplayName                          : Kiosec
DistinguishedName                    : CN=Kiosec,OU=Consulting,OU=People,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com
[...]
```

##### ➤ Enumerate and filter

- -Filter : parameter that allows more control over enumeration and use the 
- Format-Table : cmdlet to display the results such as the following neatly

```
# Display the Name and SamAccountName of user finishing by admin
PS C:\> Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like "*admin"' -Server my.domain.com | Format-Table Name,SamAccountName -A
Name             SamAccountName
----             --------------
kiosec.admin     kiosec.admin
user1.admin      user1.admin
another.admin    another.admin
[...]
```

##### ➤ Enumerate a specific AD groups

```
#Enumerate the AD group Administrators
PS C:\> Get-ADGroup -Identity Administrators -Server my.domain.com -properties *
DistinguishedName : CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Name              : Administrators
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : f4d1cbcd-4a6f-4531-8550-0394c3273c4f
SamAccountName    : Administrators
SID               : S-1-5-32-544
[...]
```

##### ➤ Enumerate group membership of an AD group

```
PS C:\> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity Administrators -Server my.domain.com

distinguishedName : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=my,DC=domain,DC=com

name              : Domain Admins
objectClass       : group

## Enumerating Active Directory
/netonly - Since we are not domain-joined, we want to load the credentials for network authentication but not authenticate against a domain controller. So commands executed locally on the computer will run in the context of your standard Windows account, but any network connections will occur using the account specified here.
/user - Here, we provide the details of the domain and the username. It is always a safe bet to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) instead of just the NetBIOS name of the domain since this will help with resolution.
cmd.exe - This is the program we want to execute once the credentials are injected. This can be changed to anything, but the safest bet is cmd.exe since you can then use that to launch whatever you want, with the credentials injected.

```
runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
```


## Test is credential is valid 
```
C:\Tools>dir \\my.domain.com\SYSVOL\
 Volume in drive \\my.domain.com\SYSVOL is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is 1634-22A9

 Directory of \\my.domain.com\SYSVOL

02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <DIR>          .
02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <DIR>          ..
02/24/2022  09:57 PM    <JUNCTION>     my.domain.com [C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain]
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  51,835,408,384 bytes free
```


Is there a difference between dir \\my.domain.com\SYSVOL and dir \\<DC IP>\SYSVOL and why the big fuss about DNS?

There is quite a difference, and it boils down to the authentication method being used. When we provide the hostname, network authentication will attempt first to perform Kerberos authentication. Since Kerberos authentication uses hostnames embedded in the tickets, if we provide the IP instead, we can force the authentication type to be NTLM. While on the surface, this does not matter to us right now, it is good to understand these slight differences since they can allow you to remain more stealthy during a Red team assessment. In some instances, organisations will be monitoring for OverPass- and Pass-The-Hash Attacks. Forcing NTLM authentication is a good trick to have in the book to avoid detection in these cases.
